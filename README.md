# CaesarCipher-EncryptDecrypt
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption method used to shift letters in a message. This program lets you easily encrypt and decrypt text, with an interactive menu for choosing either function.

Features
Encrypt: Converts plain text to encrypted text by shifting each letter forward by a specified number of positions.
Decrypt: Reverts encrypted text back to its original form by shifting each letter backward.
Interactive Menu: Choose to encrypt, decrypt, or exit.
How to Use

Select an Option:

Choose 1 to enter a word for encryption.
Choose 2 to enter a word for decryption.
Choose 3 to exit.
Enter Text:

Type a word for encryption or decryption as prompted.
View the output in the terminal.

Example
plaintext
Copy code
Choose an option:
1. Encrypt a word
2. Decrypt a word
3. Exit

Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1
